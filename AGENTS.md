# Agents — Oracle Swarm Extension

This extension provides 4 specialized agents that complement Compound Engineering's 27 agents.

**CRITICAL**: Read ALL sections before starting any work!

---

## When Working With Me

- Be concise, skip obvious explanations
- Just make the fix, don't ask permission for small changes
- If something's unclear, make a reasonable assumption and note it
- **After starting/restarting the dev server**, always smoke test: wait for ready, curl the homepage, then agent-browser open key pages affected by recent changes
- Backpressure is required: tasks must define verification commands and/or LLM subjective checks

---

## CRITICAL RULES (ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW)

### Rule 1: Never Delete Files Without Permission
You may NOT delete files without explicit permission. Even files you created. Ask first, always.

### Rule 2: No File Proliferation
NEVER create `file_v2.js`, `file_improved.js`, `file_enhanced.js`, etc. Revise existing files in place.

### Rule 3: No Automated Code Transforms  
NEVER run scripts that process/change code files. Make changes manually. Use subagents in parallel for many simple changes.

### Rule 4: Simplicity Check
Before committing: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify."

## Note for Codex/GPT-5.2 (READ THIS!)

If you are Codex or GPT-5.2 (or any non-Claude agent): another agent may have made changes since you last saw the code. Before assuming your mental model is correct:

```bash
git status              # See uncommitted changes
git log --oneline -5    # See recent commits
```

**Re-read any files you plan to modify.** This prevents overwriting another agent's work.

### Skills (Short)
- Skills live in `skills/` and work in both Claude Code and Codex.
- Codex setup (once): `./scripts/setup_codex_skills.sh`, then run `codex --enable skills`.
- Invoke skills with `$skill-name` or describe what you want.

### ⚠️ Check Existing Oracle State FIRST

**Before running any Oracle command, check what already exists:**

```bash
# Check existing state
ls -la artifacts/06-oracle/<kind>/ 2>/dev/null
cat artifacts/06-oracle/<kind>/convergence-history.json 2>/dev/null
```

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Already converged (0 blockers, ≤2 majors) | Done — no action needed |
| Unapplied feedback exists | Apply feedback first |
| No Oracle output | Run Oracle |

### Long-Running Oracle Processes (CRITICAL for Codex)
- Oracle CLI can take 60–90 minutes. Do **not** interrupt.
- Monitor: `pgrep -fl oracle`, `tail -f artifacts/06-oracle/*/oracle-*.log`
- Apply feedback from newest `*_product.md` after completion.

## ITERATION REQUIREMENTS (Doodlestein Methodology)

> "Planning tokens are a lot fewer and cheaper than implementation tokens."
> — Jeffrey Emanuel (@doodlestein)

**Time Distribution**: 85% planning, 15% implementation

| Phase | Minimum Iterations | Convergence Criteria |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Plan review | 4-5 passes | Suggestions become incremental |
| Beads review | 6-9 passes | No more changes |
| Fresh eyes code review | Until stable | No bugs found |
| Oracle review | Until converged | 0 new blockers/majors |

### Key Prompts (Use These Verbatim!)

**Before reviewing beads:**
```
Reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind.
```

**After completing a task:**
```
Great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you
just wrote and other existing code you just modified with "fresh eyes"
looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues,
confusion, etc.

**FIRST CHECK**: Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? 
If yes, simplify it first.

Carefully fix anything you uncover. Use ultrathink.
```
→ **Keep running this until no bugs are found!**

**Beads review (run 6-9 times):**
```
Check over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense?
Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better?

DO NOT OVERSIMPLIFY THINGS! DO NOT LOSE ANY FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY!
```

See `skills/phase-transitions/SKILL.md` for the complete prompt library.

## oracle-coordinator

**Role**: Orchestrates multi-lens Oracle review runs.

**When to use**:
- Automated Oracle workflows (e.g., `/combined-lfg`)
- When running multiple lenses in sequence
- When tracking Oracle output across phases

**Capabilities**:
- Generates Oracle CLI commands for each lens
- Monitors for output file creation
- Normalizes outputs to issues.json
- Summarizes findings by severity/category
- Tracks unresolved blockers across phases
- **Iterates until convergence (0 new issues)**

**Prompt**:
```
You are the Oracle Coordinator. Your job is to run GPT-5.2 Pro review loops via the Oracle CLI (browser mode only). You generate commands, wait for outputs, and normalize results.

CRITICAL: Keep running Oracle until issues converge to zero. Do not stop after a single pass!
```

---

## artifact-validator

**Role**: Validates artifact completeness and ordering.

**When to use**:
- Before phase transitions (e.g., before coding)
- When user asks "what's next?" or "where am I?"
- After Oracle reviews to check blocker status

**Capabilities**:
- Checks artifact existence and completeness
- Validates required sections in each artifact
- Reports unresolved Oracle blockers
- **Checks Oracle convergence status**
- Suggests next action based on workflow state

**Prompt**:
```
You are the Artifact Validator. Your job is to ensure the artifact chain is complete and properly ordered. Check for missing artifacts, incomplete sections, and unresolved blockers.

CRITICAL: Do not approve phase transitions until Oracle reviews have CONVERGED (0 new blockers/majors).
```

---

## design-synthesizer

**Role**: Synthesizes tasteboard into keystone and variants.

**When to use**:
- During `/ui` command execution
- When generating HTML prototypes from design references
- When creating variant explorations

**Capabilities**:
- Extracts design principles from tasteboard
- Generates keystone HTML with realistic content
- Creates 6-12 variant HTML files
- Builds design manifest for gallery

**Prompt**:
```
You are the Design Synthesizer. Your job is to transform design references (tasteboard) into production-quality HTML prototypes. You create a keystone screen and multiple variants exploring different directions.
```

---

## release-planner

**Role**: Generates release plans from verification results.

**When to use**:
- During `/ship` command execution
- When creating rollout/rollback strategies
- When documenting release readiness

**Capabilities**:
- Reads verification report (artifact 07)
- Generates rollout steps with checkpoints
- Creates monitoring and alerting requirements
- Documents rollback procedures
- Prepares customer communications

**Prompt**:
```
You are the Release Planner. Your job is to create comprehensive release plans with rollout steps, monitoring, and rollback procedures. You ensure releases are safe and reversible.
```

### Ralph Backpressure (UPDATED)

**Every task must define verification/backpressure** (tests, typecheck, lint, etc).

Task graph:
- `verification`: required commands (array of strings)
- `llmVerification`: optional subjective checks (array of strings)

Beads:
- Include sections in the bead description:
  - `Verification:` (commands, one per line)
  - `LLM Verification:` or `Subjective Checks:` (criteria, one per line)
  - `Allowed Paths:` (optional)

Repo-wide defaults (for non-Node projects):
- `verification.txt` at repo root **or**
- `RALPH_DEFAULT_VERIFY` env var **or**
- `--default-verify "<cmds>"` flag

**LLM-only verification is allowed** if no commands exist, but it still must pass.

### Ralph Agent Roles (What Each Agent Should Do)

**Implementer (Claude/Codex)**
- Read task, allowed paths, verification, and LLM checks.
- Implement ONE task; add/modify tests as required.
- Run task verification + build verification before claiming completion.
- Do not commit; Ralph handles commits/PRs.

**Reviewer (Claude/Codex, cross-model by default)**
- Use fresh context.
- Output `NO_ISSUES_FOUND` exactly or list `[P1|P2|P3]` issues with file/line.
- Focus on correctness, edge cases, regressions, and test quality.

**LLM Judge (subjective checks)**
- Binary: `LLM_PASS` or `LLM_FAIL` with 1-line reason.
- Uses diff and changed files only; if unverified, fail.

**Council Roles**
- Analyst: correctness, architecture, performance risks.
- Sentinel: anti-patterns, security, "test cheating".
- Designer: UI/UX quality, accessibility, visual hierarchy.
- Healer: fix issues found by other roles; re-run verification after fixes.

### Skills (Within Claude Code)

Claude Code uses skills from `skills/` directory:
- `phase-transitions` — Transformation prompts between phases
- `review-loops` — Iteration methodology for reviews
- `artifact-workflow` — Artifact chain management
- `oracle-integration` — Oracle CLI wrapper
- `ui-exploration` — Design workflow
